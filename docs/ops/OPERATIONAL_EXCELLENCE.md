## Monitoring & Observability

### Health Checks
```bash
# Automated health monitoring every 30s
npm run scripts/ops/health-check-monitor.sh
```

**Monitored Components:**
- Database connection pool utilization (<90%)
- API response times (p50, p95, p99)
- WebSocket active connections
- Memory usage per container (<80%)
- CPU utilization per pod (<70%)
- Disk usage (<75%)

### Alerting Rules
| Alert | Threshold | Severity | Response Time |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| API Latency | p95 >500ms for 5min | High | <15min |
| Database Connections | >90% for 2min | Critical | <5min |
| Error Rate | >1% for 5min | High | <15min |
| Service Down | Any service unreachable | Critical | <5min |
| Memory Usage | >85% for 10min | Medium | <30min |

### Logging Strategy
```typescript
// Structured logging with context
logger.info('API request completed', {
  requestId: req.id,
  userId: req.user.id,
  method: req.method,
  path: req.path,
  duration: elapsed,
  statusCode: res.statusCode
});
```

**Log Retention:**
- Application logs: 90 days
- Security audit logs: 365 days
- Access logs: 180 days

## Incident Response

### Severity Levels
| Severity | Definition | Response SLA | Example |
|----------|------------|--------------|---------|
| P0 (Critical) | Platform down | 15min | Database unavailable |
| P1 (High) | Major feature impaired | 1 hour | Payment processing failing |
| P2 (Medium) | Minor feature impaired | 4 hours | Dashboard widget broken |
| P3 (Low) | Cosmetic issue | 24 hours | Styling inconsistency |

### Incident Workflow
1. **Detection:** Automated alert triggers (PagerDuty)
2. **Triage:** On-call engineer assesses severity (15min)
3. **Escalation:** P0/P1 incidents escalate to senior engineer
4. **Communication:** Status page updated within 30min
5. **Resolution:** Fix deployed and verified
6. **Postmortem:** Root cause analysis within 48h

### On-Call Rotation
- **Schedule:** 7-day rotations, 24/7 coverage
- **Handoff:** Thursday 9am PST
- **Compensation:** $500/week on-call stipend
- **Escalation Path:** Engineer → Senior → Architect → CTO

## Deployment Practices

### Deployment Frequency
- **Production:** 2-3 times per week
- **Staging:** 10+ times per week
- **Canary Deployment:** 10% traffic for 30min before full rollout

### Deployment Checklist
```bash
# Pre-deployment
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run test

# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Run smoke tests
npm run smoke-test

# Deploy to production (canary)
npm run deploy:production --canary=10

# Monitor metrics for 30min
npm run ops:monitor --duration=30

# Full rollout
npm run deploy:production --canary=100
```

### Rollback Procedure
```bash
# Immediate rollback if error rate >2%
npm run deploy:rollback --version=previous

# Verify rollback success
npm run smoke-test
```

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- **Database:** Automated hourly snapshots, 30-day retention
- **Configuration:** Version-controlled in git
- **Secrets:** Backed up in 1Password with 2-person approval

### Recovery Objectives
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** 1 hour
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** 1 hour (max data loss)

### DR Testing
```bash
# Quarterly DR drills
npm run dr:test --mode=full
```

**Last DR Test:** 2026-01-15 (Success)
**Next DR Test:** 2026-04-15

## Capacity Planning

### Growth Projections
| Quarter | Users | Traffic (req/s) | Infrastructure Cost |
|---------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Q1 2026 | 50K | 1,500 | $8K/month |
| Q2 2026 | 75K | 2,250 | $10K/month |
| Q3 2026 | 100K | 3,000 | $12K/month |
| Q4 2026 | 150K | 4,500 | $16K/month |

### Scaling Triggers
- **Scale Up:** CPU >70% for 15min OR Memory >80% for 15min
- **Scale Down:** CPU <30% for 60min AND Memory <50% for 60min

## Cost Optimization

### Cost Breakdown
- **Compute (50%):** $4,000/month (AWS EC2/ECS)
- **Database (25%):** $2,000/month (Supabase Pro)
- **CDN (10%):** $800/month (Cloudflare)
- **Monitoring (10%):** $800/month (Datadog + PagerDuty)
- **Misc (5%):** $400/month (Secrets, backups)

### Optimization Initiatives
1. Reserved instances: 20% savings ($800/month)
2. Right-sizing pods: 15% savings ($600/month)
3. CDN cache optimization: 10% savings ($200/month)
4. Database query optimization: 5% savings ($100/month)

**Total Savings Potential:** $1,700/month (21%)

## Continuous Improvement
