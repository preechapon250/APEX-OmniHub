# Security Hardening Checklist

## Executive Summary
APEX OmniHub implements defense-in-depth security with zero-trust architecture, achieving enterprise-grade protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

## Security Layers

### L1: Application Security
- [x] TypeScript strict mode enforced (no `any` types)
- [x] Input validation with Zod schemas on all API endpoints
- [x] XSS prevention via Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [x] SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries (Supabase RLS)
- [x] CSRF protection with SameSite cookies
- [x] Rate limiting: 100 req/min per IP
- [x] Prompt injection defense for LLM inputs

### L2: Authentication & Authorization
- [x] Zero-trust architecture implemented
- [x] Row-Level Security (RLS) on all Supabase tables
- [x] JWT tokens with 1-hour expiration
- [x] MFA enforcement for admin accounts
- [x] Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with 5 permission levels
- [x] Session management with automatic timeout (30min idle)

### L3: Data Protection
- [x] Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- [x] Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- [x] Secrets management via environment variables (never in code)
- [x] Database backups: hourly snapshots, 30-day retention
- [x] PII data tokenization for payment processing
- [x] GDPR data deletion workflows

### L4: Infrastructure Security
- [x] Network segmentation (VPC isolation)
- [x] Firewall rules: whitelist-only ingress
- [x] DDoS protection (Cloudflare)
- [x] Web Application Firewall (WAF) enabled
- [x] Container image scanning (Snyk)
- [x] Dependency vulnerability scanning (npm audit)

### L5: Monitoring & Incident Response
- [x] Security audit logging (all auth events)
- [x] Real-time anomaly detection
- [x] Automated secret scanning (TruffleHog + Gitleaks)
- [x] Incident response runbook documented
- [x] Security patch SLA: <24h for critical CVEs
- [x] Penetration testing: quarterly external audits

## Compliance Matrix

| Standard | Requirement | Implementation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| SOC 2 CC6.1 | Logical access controls | Zero-trust + RLS + RBAC |
| SOC 2 CC7.2 | System monitoring | Real-time security logs |
| ISO 27001 A.9.4 | Access restrictions | MFA + session timeouts |
| ISO 27001 A.18.1 | Compliance requirements | Automated audit trails |
| GDPR Art. 32 | Security measures | Encryption + tokenization |
| PCI DSS 6.5 | Secure development | OWASP Top 10 coverage |

## Security Testing

### Automated Scans
```bash
npm run secret:scan && npm run security:audit
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Run prompt defense tests
npm run test:prompt-defense

# Run security regression tests
npm run test:security
```

## Vulnerability Response SLA
- **Critical:** Patch within 24 hours
- **High:** Patch within 7 days
- **Medium:** Patch within 30 days
- **Low:** Addressed in next release

## Audit Trail
All security events logged to `src/security/securityAuditLogger.ts`

**Review Cycle:** Monthly security review with CISO
