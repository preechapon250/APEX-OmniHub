# SECURITY ADVISORY - ENV FILE EXPOSURE
**Date:** 2026-01-03
**Severity:** MEDIUM (Mitigated)
**Status:** REMEDIATED

---

## ISSUE SUMMARY

**Finding:** `.env` file containing Supabase credentials was present in the repository and committed to git history.

**Git History Evidence:**
```bash
$ git log --all --full-history --oneline -- .env
92224a6 Fix: Resolve missing StrideGuide icon
```

**Exposed Credentials:**
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`: wwajmaohwcbooljdureo
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9... (anon key)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: https://wwajmaohwcbooljdureo.supabase.co

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

**Severity:** MEDIUM (Low-Medium)

**Rationale:**
1. **Publishable Keys:** These are Supabase "anon" keys, designed for client-side use
2. **Public by Design:** VITE_ prefix indicates these are bundled in frontend code (publicly accessible)
3. **Limited Scope:** Anon keys have restricted permissions via Row Level Security (RLS)
4. **Protected by RLS:** Database access is protected by Row Level Security policies

**However:**
- Having `.env` in git violates security best practices
- Sets dangerous precedent (could accidentally commit sensitive keys)
- Git history is permanent (even after deletion, keys remain in history)

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN

1. ✅ **Deleted `.env` file** from working directory (2026-01-03)
2. ✅ **Verified `.env` in `.gitignore`** (line 16 of .gitignore)
3. ✅ **Confirmed `.env.example` exists** with proper documentation

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### 1. Rotate Supabase Keys (OPTIONAL - Low Priority)

**Why Optional:**
- Current keys are "anon" keys (designed for public exposure)
- Protected by RLS (database-level security)
- No evidence of abuse or unauthorized access

**If Rotating (for maximum security):**

```bash
# 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
https://app.supabase.com/project/wwajmaohwcbooljdureo/settings/api

# 2. Generate new anon key
Click "Generate new anon key" (if available)
OR
Reset the project API keys (caution: breaks existing deployments)

# 3. Update environment variables in:
- Vercel Dashboard (production secrets)
- Supabase CLI config
- Local .env.local files (all developers)

# 4. Test deployment before rolling out
Deploy to staging, verify functionality

# 5. Rollout to production
Update Vercel environment variables
Trigger new deployment
```

**Impact of Rotation:**
- All deployed frontends will need redeployment
- All developers need new .env.local
- Downtime: ~5 minutes during redeployment

**Recommendation:** Rotate only if evidence of abuse or as part of regular 90-day rotation policy.

---

### 2. Implement Git Secrets Scanning (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Install git-secrets or TruffleHog:**

```bash
# Option 1: git-secrets (AWS tool)
brew install git-secrets
git secrets --install
git secrets --register-aws

# Option 2: TruffleHog (more comprehensive)
brew install trufflesecurity/trufflehog/trufflehog

# Scan entire git history
trufflehog git file://. --only-verified
```

**Add to CI/CD:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Secret Scanning
  uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main
  with:
    path: ./
    base: ${{ github.event.repository.default_branch }}
    head: HEAD
```

---

### 3. Developer Education

**Distribute to Team:**

**DO:**
- ✅ Use `.env.local` for local development (gitignored)
- ✅ Copy from `.env.example` when starting
- ✅ Never commit `.env` or `.env.local`
- ✅ Use environment variables in CI/CD (GitHub Secrets)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Never commit `.env` files
- ❌ Never hardcode API keys in code
- ❌ Never share secrets via Slack/email (use password manager)
- ❌ Never commit `*.pem`, `*.key`, `credentials.json`

---

### 4. Secrets Management (NEXT PHASE)

**Phase 1 (Week 1 - Current):**
- ✅ Remove .env from repo
- ✅ Document rotation procedures

**Phase 2 (Week 1-2):**
- [ ] Integrate HashiCorp Vault or Doppler
- [ ] Migrate all secrets to secrets manager
- [ ] Implement automatic rotation (90-day cycle)

**Phase 3 (Week 3-4):**
- [ ] Set up secret access audit logging
- [ ] Implement least-privilege access (who can read which secrets)

---

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [x] `.env` file deleted from working directory
- [x] `.env` confirmed in `.gitignore`
- [x] `.env.example` exists with proper documentation
- [x] Git history checked (file was in history at commit 92224a6)
- [x] Risk assessment completed (MEDIUM severity, LOW actual risk)
- [ ] Team notified of proper .env usage
- [ ] Git secrets scanning added to CI/CD (TO DO in next task)
- [ ] Keys rotated (OPTIONAL - not yet done, low priority)

---

## LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Prevention:** Always use `.env.local` (gitignored by default)
2. **Detection:** Implement secret scanning in CI/CD
3. **Response:** Have rotation procedures ready
4. **Education:** Train team on secrets management

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Commit .env deletion** to git
2. **Add secret scanning** to CI/CD pipeline
3. **Set up secrets manager** (Vault or Doppler)
4. **Schedule key rotation** (optional, 90-day cycle)

---

**Remediation Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Follow-up Required:** Secrets manager integration (Phase 1, Week 1-2)
