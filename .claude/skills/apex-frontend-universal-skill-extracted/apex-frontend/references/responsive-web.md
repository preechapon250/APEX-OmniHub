# Responsive Web UI

## Layout strategy
- Mobile-first breakpoints
- Fluid type (clamp) where appropriate
- Containers with max-width + gutters
- Avoid relying on hover; provide focus/active equivalents

## Common traps
- Layout shift from images/fonts
- Modals not scrollable on small screens
- Sticky headers covering anchors
- Focus trapped or lost

## Checklist
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Focus visible
- [ ] No horizontal scroll
- [ ] Touch targets sufficient on mobile web
- [ ] Reduced motion supported
