# Design Review (Universal)

Check:
- UX: primary task obvious; no dead ends; recovery paths exist
- UI: hierarchy obvious; spacing consistent; distinctive signature exists
- A11y: labels, focus order, large text, contrast
- Perf: lists/images/effects not causing jank
- Engineering: state and effects isolated; regression prevention exists
