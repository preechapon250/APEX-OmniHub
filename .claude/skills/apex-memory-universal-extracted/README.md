## [*] Overview

APEX-Memory(TM) is a **proprietary, production-grade** skill package that exponentially enhances any AI model's ability to retain context, prevent hallucinations, and persist memory across sessions. It operates silently in the background through research-backed cognitive protocols.

### Key Capabilities

| Capability                  | Target                                    | Method                                   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **100x Context Capacity**   | Process 100x more information effectively | Intelligent multi-layer compression      |
| **Zero Hallucinations**     | <1% false claim rate                      | Provenance tracking + confidence scoring |
| **Perfect Recall**          | 95%+ accuracy at 100+ turns               | 3-Tier hierarchical memory architecture  |
| **Cross-Session Memory**    | Portable session dumps                    | Structured persistence protocol          |
| **Universal Compatibility** | All LLMs                                  | Model-agnostic cognitive protocols       |

## [*] Installation

### For Any AI Agent

```bash
# Copy the skill folder to your agent's skills directory
cp -r apex-memory/ /path/to/your/agent/skills/

# Or inject SKILL.md into your system prompt directly
```

### For Claude Code

See the dedicated **APEX-Memory(TM) Claude Edition** package with full frontmatter compliance.
