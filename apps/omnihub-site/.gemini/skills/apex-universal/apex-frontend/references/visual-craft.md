# Visual Craft (Universal)

- Commit to an art direction (1 primary + 1 accent).
- Build a tight token system: neutral base + decisive accents.
- Typography: distinctive display + readable body; consistent scale.
- Spacing rhythm: pick a scale and align edges precisely.
- Add one signature moment (hero, motion, shape language) to avoid generic UI.

Avoid:
- Default component-library aesthetics without customization
- Vague hierarchies and inconsistent spacing
