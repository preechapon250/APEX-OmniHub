# Microcopy Playbook

Goal: copy that **reduces errors**, **builds trust**, and **moves users forward**.

## Principles
1) **Actionable**: tells users what to do next.
2) **Specific**: avoids vague “Something went wrong.”
3) **Blameless**: system owns errors; user isn’t at fault.
4) **Consistent**: same term for same thing.
5) **Scannable**: short sentences; front-load key info.

## CTA formula
Verb + object + outcome
- “Save changes”
- “Create project”
- “Add card”
Avoid:
- “Submit”
- “Continue” (unless context is obvious)

## Error message formula
**What happened** + **why** (if known) + **what to do** + **keep input**
Examples:
- “Couldn’t save. You’re offline. Reconnect and try again.”
- “Password must be at least 12 characters.”

## Empty states: 3 parts
- Title: “No saved items yet”
- Body: benefit/why it’s empty
- Action: “Browse items”

## Tone dial
Set tone explicitly:
- Crisp/professional
- Warm/supportive
- Playful (use sparingly; don’t joke in errors for serious contexts)

## Localization readiness
- Avoid embedded variables in odd places
- Avoid idioms
- Plan for 30–50% text expansion

## Microcopy checklist
- [ ] Titles describe the user goal
- [ ] CTAs start with verbs
- [ ] Errors explain recovery
- [ ] Consistent terminology across screens
- [ ] No dark-pattern wording
