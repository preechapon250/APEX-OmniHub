# Design-to-Dev Handoff

## What engineers need (minimum)
- Flow + screen list
- Component inventory (reusable vs one-off)
- Tokens (colors, type, spacing, radius, elevation, motion)
- States & edge cases
- Copy text (including errors)
- Acceptance criteria (testable)
- Analytics events for funnel steps

## Recommended artifacts
- Screen spec per screen: `assets/templates/screen-spec.md`
- Component specs for key components
- A11y notes
- Perf notes (large lists, images, animations)

## Handoff pitfalls
- Missing empty/error states
- Ambiguous spacing/type sizes
- Hidden dependencies (permissions, network)
- Microcopy not finalized (creates rework)
